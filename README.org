** Description
This project is being worked on for my studies
at EPITECH. Since the actual project is split
into 3 repositories, I decided to create my own
in order to keep track of my progress and organize
the project better.

** Documentation
For documentation, please check out [[https://github.com/Bard-Gaming/42sh/tree/main/docs][/docs]].

** Compile Instructions
This project uses ~GNU Make~ to compile.

To compile the standard version of mysh,
simply run make:
#+begin_src bash
make
#+end_src

To compile a version with debug symbols enabled,
use the ~debug~ rule:
#+begin_src bash
make debug
#+end_src

To compile a version with an address sanitizer enabled,
use the ~sanitize~ rule:
#+begin_src bash
make sanitize
#+end_src

When you're done, you can use the ~clean~ rule
to delete any temporary files, and the ~fclean~
rule to delete all compiled files.
