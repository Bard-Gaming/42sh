* Pipes
The pipe operator (~|~) allows the user to take the output
of one command, and use it as the input for another command.

** Syntax
The syntax for pipe operations is as follows:
#+begin_src
<command> "|" <command>
#+end_src

Note that both commands are required for the operation to
succeed.
The operation is done whether or not the first command has
a non-zero exit status or not.

** Examples
#+begin_src bash
# search for files that contain the word "important" in the current work directory:
ls | grep important

# pipes work with the output of everything on the left hand side:
(echo file1; echo file 2; ls; echo file 3) | sort | cat
#+end_src
